However straightforward this requirement, the technical implementation is often a challenge since these applications all require specific front-end customisations. When deploying multiple customized Share front-end for these business applications, some aspects such as workflows, dashboards, etc. cannot be easily separated.  One option is building your front-end applications from scratch, but that ignores the wealth of functionality that is available in Share out-of-the-box. Moreover some organizations already use Share as a front-end and would like to keep a consistent experience for their users.  In this talk we share our experience on using multiple customized Share instances as business application front-end on the same Alfresco repository. Some potential pitfalls when developing such solutions are:  * The use of specific personal dashboards for each application, which conflicts with the current single dashboard configuration within Alfresco  * The definition of application-specific workflows, which conflicts with Shareâ€™s default behavior of showing all defined workflows  * Out-of-the-box dashlets whose queries are not limited to your application scope.  * â€¦  This talk will give an overview of some of the more dangerous pitfalls we encountered, how we solved them and what best practices to keep in mind."}

But then if you have hundreds of rules which set permissions at the node-level it will be difficult to maintain all of this.  Also, in an enterprise environment Alfresco is probably not the only application developed. You might already have business rules and business data in place. You obviously want to re-use the existing and even centralize it. These are some of the reasons which led us in a direction of externalizing the permission system in a Business Rules Engine. Our instance of Alfresco Community now calls the rules-engine to ask whether or not a person has a permission on a document.

A lot of search use cases are not covered with out of the box flat SOLR indexing. Sometimes users need to search complex nested objects, not just files. (It's more or less about indexing associations - 'I'd like to find all cases (node A), created by the company (node B) with name matching this, and containing child documents (nodes C) registered not later than that date' - it's quite hard to match this query having only nodes properties in the index.) We implemented an external SOLR Cloud integrated with sharded Alfresco installation to serve such complex search requests using custom indexing logic based on SOLR nested objects. In this talk we will cover reasons for such custom indexing architecture, and share an experience of its implementation.

To help standardise the build, Daren Firminger and Martin Cosgrave developed a puppet-based installer system which became the first iteration of the Honeycomb distribution.  We'll talk about the choices we made during the development process, some of the difficulties encountered as well as some of the benefits of the approach. Then we'll turn our attention to Docker, a lightweight containerisation system that can bring other benefits to Honeycomb, such as being the jumping off point for developing a high-availability solution for Community Alfresco"}

Since then there have been two product releases of the Alfresco ECM product and more than 70 incremental releases of the Aikau framework. In addition to new features of the core product, various official and community addons now use the framework to enhance or customize the Share application. This talk aims to give an external point-of-view on how the Aikau framework helps users tackle their business requirements in developing both basic customisations to existing functionality and complex, custom business applications. It will look at a sub-set of use cases that are supported by or that members of the community have implemented on top of Aikau, and review the advantages and potential short-comings of the framework in that context. Additionally, the talk will try to summarize community concerns and expectations regarding the future of Aikau, and how the community can work together to make those expectations a reality."},
