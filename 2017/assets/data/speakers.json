Years later it is sometimes stil astounding how little people know about that feature and how few people actively use it. Considering the spotty documentation and bad experiences with performance that float around / are passed along in the community, it is high time to look at this feature a bit more closely. This talk will provide a general overview of transactional metadata query functionality and showcase example use cases. In some cases proper use of transactional metadata queries may necessitate small changes to data modelling or logic, and this talk will list common considerations. Lastly, we will look at typical issues with query performance and how these can be dealth withor avoided.</p>",

Changes of a business record will be reflected on the document space.</p><p>Through a dedicated user interface in Odoo, Odoo users can perform common document operations, like uploading and versioning documents, without leaving their familiar user interface. Of course, users can access and manage the document space and its contents through Share and the other Alfresco interfaces to use the full functionality of these interfaces.</p><p>From a technical point of view, AlfOdoo is a fine example of integrating Alfresco with CMIS V1.1 into another software package.</p><p>This talk will illustrate how easy it is to extend the Odoo platform in order to classify the content related to ERP business records in Alfresco.</p>",
